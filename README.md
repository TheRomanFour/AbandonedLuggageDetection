# AbandonedLuggageDetection
This project implements a real-time object tracking and abandonment detection system using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The primary focus is on detecting and tracking persons and suitcases in a video feed, and identifying potentially abandoned suitcases based on their movement and proximity to people.
